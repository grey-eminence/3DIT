									<p>People spend all their lives in a 3D world and they develop skills for manipulating 3D objects, navigating around the 3D world, and interpreting 3D spatial relationships. However, they often find it difficult to interact in 3D environments. Quite often, this is the result of a not properly designed user interface or due to inappropriate selection of interaction techniques. 
									This website was created to aid both researchers and developers of interactive 3D applications in having a clearer overview of the topic of 3D interaction and in particular can be useful for practitioners and researchers that are new to the field of interactive 3D graphics.</p>

	                                <p>We need practical tools to carry out the research and as 3D is becoming more popular on the Web, it is clear that we need firmer and more "hands-on" understanding of 3D interaction principles. Therefore, we developed a <a>testbed</a> that was designed for the experimentation and for the assessment of different 3D interaction techniques. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. There is a huge number of 3D interaction techniques and obviously no single interaction method can be considered perfect for any task and any 3D scene. Choosing a suitable interaction technique to a given application is not easy, since applications may have very different requirements. Therefore, we aim to provide a simple classification allowing a designer or a programmer to choose the best compromise for his/her needs.</p>

	                                <h2>Content&amp;Tasks</h2>
	                                <p>One problem with the research work on 3D interaction is that there are no clearly defined evaluation methods, stimuli as well as representative tasks akin to those found in other dysciplines of science. Most often, researchers trying to propose a new 3D interaction technique have to spend considerable time not only on its development, but also on authoring new content and tasks for the technique's evaluation.
						    		This page is intended to list 3D environments that can be easly employed in testing different interaction techniques. The environments are accompanied by the tasks that can be reused by evaluators.</p>
