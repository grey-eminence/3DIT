									<p><!-- People spend all their lives in a 3D world and they develop skills for manipulating 3D objects, navigating around the 3D world, and interpreting 3D spatial relationships. However, they often find it difficult to interact in 3D environments. Quite often, this is the result of a not properly designed user interface or due to inappropriate selection of interaction techniques.  -->
									This website was created to aid both researchers and developers of interactive 3D applications in having a clearer overview of the topic of 3D interaction. In particular it can be useful for practitioners and researchers that are new to the field of interactive 3D graphics.
									The site is also intended to be a testbed allowing for easier experimentation and assessment of different 3D interaction techniques.</p>
									<p>The testbed consists of three main parts: </p>

									<ul id="welcomeList">
										<li><a href="">Online Demonstrator</a> - As there is no single interaction method can be considered perfect for any task and any 3D scene, the demonstrator provides a simple classification together with demonstrations of the 3D interaction techniques allowing a designer or a programmer to choose the best compromise for his/her needs.</li>
										<li><a href="">Content&amp;Tasks</a> - Most often, researchers trying to propose a new 3D interaction technique have to spend considerable time not only on its development, but also on authoring new content and tasks for the technique's evaluation. The content&amp;tasks page is intended to list 3D environments that can be easly employed in testing different interaction techniques. The environments are also accompanied by the tasks that can be reused by evaluators.</li>
										<li><a href="">Studies&amp;Results</a> - This section lists the 3DUI related publications together with the information about used environments, implementations, tasks, and results, the information that can be helpful not only to replicate the research (replicability is the foundation of research in many dysciplines of science), but also to lower the barier for the development of new interaction techniques.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>You are more than welcome to contribute!</h2>

									<p>The 3DIT project was started by a few passionate about 3D interaction researchers from the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/potioc/">Potioc group</a> from <a href="https://www.inria.fr/">Inria</a>. Its purpose is to allow a <i>"hands-on"</i> understanding of 3D interaction principles, but also to create an open platform for defining evaluation methods, stimuli as well as representative tasks akin to those found in other dysciplines of science. Therefore, the project is an open source initiative and any contribution to the project is more than welcome! The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/grey-eminence/3DIT">github</a>; please refer <a href="https://github.com/grey-eminence/3DIT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a> to learn how to contribute to 3DIT.</p>

	                                <!-- <p>Choosing a suitable interaction technique to a given application is not easy, since applications may have very different requirements. </p> -->
									<!-- As 3D is becoming more popular on the Web, it is clear that we need firmer and more "hands-on" understanding of 3D interaction principles. -->
